## War Card Game

### Overview

*War* is a simple card game for two players, where the goal is to win all the cards in the deck. The game involves two players using a standard deck of 52 cards and competing to have the highest card in each round.

### Objective

The objective of *War* is to collect all the cards in the deck by winning rounds. Players compete by each drawing a card from their deck, and the player with the higher card wins the round and takes both cards.

### Rules of Play

1. **Setup**: Shuffle the deck and deal the entire deck evenly between the two players. Each player has their own stack of cards, face down.
2. **Gameplay**:
   - Both players simultaneously draw the top card from their stack and place it face-up in the center.
   - The player with the higher card wins both cards and places them at the bottom of their stack.
   - If the cards are of equal rank, a "war" is triggered:
     - Each player places three cards face down in the center and then draws a fourth card.
     - The player with the higher fourth card wins all the cards in the center. If there is another tie, the war continues until a winner is determined.
3. **End of the Game**: The game ends when one player has all the cards or when players decide to stop playing. The winner is the player who has collected all the cards.

### Card Ranks

Cards in *War* are ranked from highest to lowest in the following order:

- Ace (highest)
- King
- Queen
- Jack
- 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 (lowest)

### Variations

There are several variations of *War*, including:
- **Multiple Decks**: Using more than one deck of cards to extend the gameplay.
- **Changing the War Rules**: Some versions may change the number of cards placed down during a war or introduce different rules for resolving ties.

### Strategy

While *War* is largely a game of chance, players may try to use strategies based on the order of cards or the number of cards they have remaining. However, the outcome is mainly determined by luck, as cards are drawn at random.
